# Customer_Churn_Analysis-P2


1.Problem Question: What is the overall churn rate of our customer base? Is it high or low relative to industry benchmarks, and should we be concerned?

2.Problem Question: Does customer churn differ significantly between male and female customers? If so, why might this be, and what actions can we take to address it?

3.Problem Question: Is there a correlation between the device customers prefer to use for logging in and their likelihood of churning? Are customers using specific devices more likely to churn, suggesting potential usability issues or dissatisfaction with those platforms?

4.Problem Question: Does churn vary across different city tiers (urban, suburban, rural)? Are customers in specific city tiers more prone to churning, potentially due to location-specific service quality or competitive factors?

5.Problem Question: How does the average tenure (length of time as a customer) differ between customers who churn and those who remain? Are we losing customers early in their lifecycle, suggesting onboarding problems, or later on, indicating long-term dissatisfaction?

6.Problem Question: Does the preferred payment method influence churn rates? Are customers using certain payment methods (e.g., manual checks) more likely to churn due to inconvenience or issues with the payment process?

7.Problem Question: How does customer satisfaction (as measured by satisfaction scores) relate to churn? Are customers with lower satisfaction scores more likely to churn, and what are the key drivers of dissatisfaction?

8.Problem Question: Is there a difference in the average cashback amount received by customers who churn versus those who don't? Could a low cashback amount be a contributing factor to churn, suggesting the cashback program isn't sufficiently attractive?

9.Problem Question: Does the number of addresses a customer has on file correlate with their likelihood of churning? Are customers with multiple addresses (e.g., due to moving or having multiple residences) more likely to churn, potentially due to logistical challenges or address-related issues?

10.Problem Question: How does filing a complaint affect a customer's likelihood of churning? Are customers who file complaints more or less likely to churn compared to those who don't complain at all, and does our complaint resolution process effectively retain dissatisfied customers?

11.Problem Question: Is there a relationship between the year-over-year increase in order amount and customer churn? Are customers who experience larger price increases more likely to churn, indicating price sensitivity or a perceived lack of value?

12.Problem Question: Does marital status influence churn rates? Are customers with different marital statuses (e.g., single, married, divorced) more prone to churning, potentially due to life changes or differing needs from the service?
